# proxypool

A Stratum to Stratum proxy pool. Released under AGPL-V3.

## Features ##

* Vardiff
* Address validation
* IP based bans for too many invalid shares
* Redis pubsub for share logging

Currently only scrypt is supported for upstream servers.

The source does not yet include the CPPSRB payout scripts, it will be released once I clean them up.
